code: vpextrq $0x0, %xmm1, (%rax)

  maybe read:      { %rax %xmm1 }
  must read:       { %rax %xmm1 }
  maybe write:     { }
  must write:      { }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { avx }

Formula:

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_64_0 (8 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.

Information about memory writes:
  Address %rax was updated to
    (%ymm1[127:0] >> 0x0₁₂₈)[63:0] (8 bytes).
