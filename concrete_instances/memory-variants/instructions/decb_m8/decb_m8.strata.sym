Formula:

%pf    : !((0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[0:0] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[1:1] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[2:2] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[3:3] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[4:4] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[5:5] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[6:6] = 0x1₁ ⊕ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[7:7] = 0x1₁)
%af    : (0xf₅ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_2[3:0])[4:4] = 0x1₁
%zf    : (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[7:0] = 0x0₈
%sf    : (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[7:7] = 0x1₁
%of    : (true ↔ TMP_BV_8_3[7:7] = 0x1₁) ∧ !(true ↔ (0xff₉ + 0x0₁ ∘ TMP_BV_8_1)[7:7] = 0x1₁)
