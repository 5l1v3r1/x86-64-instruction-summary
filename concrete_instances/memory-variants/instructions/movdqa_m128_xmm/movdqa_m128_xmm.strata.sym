  maybe read:      { %rax %xmm1 }

  required flags:  { sse2 }

Formula:

Information about memory reads:
  Value <TMP_BV_128_0|128> (16 bytes)
    was read at address <%rax|64>.

Information about memory writes:
  Address <%rax|64> was updated to
    <%ymm1|256>[127:0] (16 bytes).

sigfpe  : <sigfpe>
sigbus  : <sigbus>
sigsegv : (or <sigsegv> (and (and (not <sigfpe>) (not <sigbus>)) FALSE))
