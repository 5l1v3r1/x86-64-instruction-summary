code: setnbe (%rax)

  maybe read:      { %rax %cf %zf }
  must read:       { %rax %cf %zf }
  maybe write:     { }
  must write:      { }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { }

Formula:

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_8_0 (1 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.

Information about memory writes:
  Address %rax was updated to
    (%cf ? 0x1₂₄ : 0x0₂₄) ∘ (%zf ? 0x1₈ : 0x0₈) = 0x0₃₂ ? 0x1₈ : 0x0₈ (1 bytes).
