Formula:

Information about memory reads:
  Value <TMP_BV_16_0|16> (2 bytes)
    was read at address <%rax|64>.

Information about memory writes:
  Address <%rax|64> was updated to
    (concat <0x0|0> (>> <%ymm1|256>[127:0] <0x0|128>)[15:0]) (2 bytes).

sigfpe  : <sigfpe>
sigbus  : <sigbus>
sigsegv : (or (or <sigsegv> (and (and (not <sigfpe>) (not <sigbus>)) FALSE)) (and (and (not <sigfpe>) (not <sigbus>)) FALSE))
