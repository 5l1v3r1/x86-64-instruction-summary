code: cmovnol (%rax), %ebx

  maybe read:      { %rax %of }
  must read:       { %rax %of }
  maybe write:     { %rbx }
  must write:      { }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { cmov }

Formula:

%rbx   : 0x0₃₂ ∘ ((%of ? 0x0₁ : 0x1₁) = 0x1₁ ? TMP_BV_32_0 : %rbx[31:0])
