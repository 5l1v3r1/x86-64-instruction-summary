  maybe read:      { %rax }

Formula:

%cf    : (or (and FALSE (== (ror <TMP_BV_8_0|8> <0x0|8>)[7:7] <0x1|1>)) (and TRUE <%cf>))
%of    : (or (and FALSE (xor (== (ror <TMP_BV_8_0|8> <0x0|8>)[7:7] <0x1|1>) (== (ror <TMP_BV_8_0|8> <0x0|8>)[6:6] <0x1|1>))) (and TRUE <TMP_BOOL_0>))

Information about memory reads:
  Value <TMP_BV_8_0|8> (1 bytes)
    was read at address <%rax|64>.

Information about memory writes:
  Address <%rax|64> was updated to
    (ror <TMP_BV_8_0|8> <0x0|8>) (1 bytes).

sigfpe  : <sigfpe>
sigbus  : <sigbus>
sigsegv : (or (or <sigsegv> (and (and (not <sigfpe>) (not <sigbus>)) FALSE)) (and (and (not <sigfpe>) (not <sigbus>)) FALSE))
