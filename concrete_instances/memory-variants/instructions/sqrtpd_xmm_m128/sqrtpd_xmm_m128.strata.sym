  maybe read:      { %rax }
  must read:       { %rax }
  maybe write:     { %xmm1 }
  must write:      { %xmm1 }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }

Formula:

%ymm1  : %ymm1[255:128] ∘ (sqrt_double(TMP_BV_128_0[127:64]) ∘ sqrt_double(TMP_BV_128_1[63:0]))

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_128_0 (16 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.
  Value TMP_BV_128_1 (16 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.
