code: cmovsl (%rax), %ebx

  maybe read:      { %rax %sf }
  must read:       { %rax %sf }
  maybe write:     { %rbx }
  must write:      { }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { cmov }

Formula:

%rbx   : 0x0₃₂ ∘ ((%sf ? 0x0₁ : 0x1₁) = 0x1₁ ? %rbx[31:0] : TMP_BV_32_0)
