Formula:

%rbx   : (concat <%rbx|64>[63:16] <TMP_BV_16_0|16>)

Information about memory reads:
  Value <TMP_BV_16_0|16> (2 bytes)
    was read at address <%rax|64>.
  Value <TMP_BV_16_1|16> (2 bytes)
    was read at address <%rax|64>.

Information about memory writes:
  Address <%rax|64> was updated to
    <%rbx|64>[15:0] (2 bytes).
