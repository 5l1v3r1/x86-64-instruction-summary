code: cmovpw (%rax), %bx

  maybe read:      { %rax %pf }
  must read:       { %rax %pf }
  maybe write:     { %bx }
  must write:      { }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { cmov }

Formula:

%rbx   : %rbx[63:16] ∘ ((%pf ? 0x1₆₄ : 0x0₆₄) = 0x0₆₄ ? %rbx[15:0] : TMP_BV_16_0)

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_16_0 (2 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.
