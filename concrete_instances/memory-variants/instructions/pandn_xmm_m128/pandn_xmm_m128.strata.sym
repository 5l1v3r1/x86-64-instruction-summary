code: pandn (%rax), %xmm1

  maybe read:      { %rax %xmm1 }
  must read:       { %rax %xmm1 }
  maybe write:     { %xmm1 }
  must write:      { %xmm1 }
  maybe undef:     { }
  must undef:      { }
  required flags:  { sse2 }

Formula:

%ymm1  : %ymm1[255:128] ∘ ((%ymm1[127:64] ⊕ (TMP_BV_128_0[127:64] | %ymm1[127:64])) ∘ (%ymm1[63:0] ⊕ (TMP_BV_128_1[63:0] | %ymm1[63:0])))

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_128_0 (16 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.
  Value TMP_BV_128_1 (16 bytes)
    was read at address %rax.
